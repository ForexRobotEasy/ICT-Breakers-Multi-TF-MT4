# ICT Breakers Multi TF MT4

## Overview
The ICT Breakers Multi TF MT4 is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It uses the Breaker Blocks indicator to identify significant shifts in the market and place trades based on the signals generated. The robot is designed to work on the MetaTrader 4 platform and can be customized with different timeframes and customization options.

## How It Works
The ICT Breakers Multi TF MT4 works by utilizing the Breaker Blocks indicator to identify trading opportunities. The indicator is set to different timeframes, including M1, M5, H1, and D1. It also has customization options that can be adjusted to suit individual preferences.

Upon initialization, the robot sets the indicator parameters and customization options. It also sets the default lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels. These values can be modified according to the user's trading strategy.

During the OnTick() function, the robot checks for breaker blocks using the CheckBreakerBlocks() method from the BreakerBlocks object. If breaker blocks are detected, the GetSignal() method is called to determine the trading signal. If the signal indicates a buy opportunity, the Buy() method from the CTrade object is executed with the specified lot size. Similarly, if the signal indicates a sell opportunity, the Sell() method is executed.

When the robot is deactivated (OnDeinit()), all open trades are closed using the CloseAll() method from the CTrade object.
